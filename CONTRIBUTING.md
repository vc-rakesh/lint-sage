Thank you for considering contributing to Lint Sage! We welcome your help and support in making this project better. This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to our project. Please take a moment to review it to ensure a smooth and effective collaboration.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## How to Contribute

We appreciate and welcome contributions in various forms, including bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, code enhancements, and more. Here's how you can get started:

1. **Fork the Repository**: If you haven't already, fork the repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local development environment.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vcian/lint-sage.git
   ```
3. **Create a Branch**: Before you start making changes to the project, it's essential to create a new branch where you'll work on your feature or bug fix. Use a descriptive branch name that summarizes your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

    Replace `feature/your-feature` with an appropriate branch name that reflects the nature of your work.

4. **Make Changes**: Now that you have your branch, you can start making changes to the project. Implement your feature, fix bugs, or make other improvements. Ensure that your code adheres to the project's coding guidelines and standards.

5. **Documentation**: If your changes affect user documentation, it's crucial to update the documentation accordingly. Clear and up-to-date documentation ensures that users can understand and use your changes effectively.

6. **Commit Changes**: Once you've made the necessary changes and are satisfied with your work, it's time to commit your changes. Use a clear and concise commit message that describes the purpose of your commit:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

    Replace `"Your commit message"` with a message that summarizes what your commit accomplishes. A well-written commit message helps others understand the purpose of your changes.

7. **Push Changes**: After committing your changes locally, it's time to push them to your forked repository on GitHub. This step ensures that your changes are available for review and integration into the main project:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```

    Replace `feature/your-feature` with the name of your branch. This command sends your changes to your GitHub repository, making them accessible for creating a pull request.

    By following these steps, you can effectively create, make changes, document, commit, and push your contributions to the project.

8. **Create a Pull Request**: Open a pull request (PR) to the main repository. Please provide a clear and informative title and description of your changes.

9. **Code Review**: Your PR will undergo code review, where feedback may be provided. Be prepared to make further changes based on the feedback.

10. **Merging**: Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the main repository.

11.  **Thank You!**: Your contribution is greatly appreciated. We thank you for your valuable help in improving Lint Sage.
